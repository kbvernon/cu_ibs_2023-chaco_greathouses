## Behavioral Ecology

or, utility maximization where proximate utility contributes to long-term inclusive fitness  

or, revealed preferences where preferences are shaped by natural selection  
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=0}
Not as reductionist as it may seem, simply the idea that people's behaviors are reasonable, that there are reasons why they do what they do.  

Two key assumptions:  

1. __Optimality__ - individuals will do what they should do to achieve their goals
2. __Sufficient knowledge__ - individuals have a sufficient number of true beliefs about their circumstances to do that
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=1}
Sometimes referred to as the "principle of charity" or the "principle of rational accommodation."

- To explain a behavior, we attribute to an individual a goal and a set of beliefs about their environment, including relevant constraints and trade-offs.  
- If there is a mismatch, if the behavior appears sub-optimal, we must revise one of our descriptions, either of the behavior itself (how it is done), the goal, the beliefs, or the environment.  
- This is rational accommodation, an attempt to understand the individual in their context.  
- The fact that we can do this is owing to natural selection.

## The Ideal Free Distribution

The __suitability__ $S_i$ of habitat $i$ is some function of its population density $D_i$

$$S_i = Q_i - f(D_i) - C_i$$

:::::: {.r-stack width=100% style="margin-top:0;" .flt}
::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index=0}
where

- $Q_i$ is the pristine suitability of $i$ or the suitability when $f(D_i)=0$, and
- $C_i$ is some additional cost of inhabiting $i$.

‚ö†Ô∏è Suitability is a synonym for per capita productivity, though it is also a proxy for inclusive fitness.
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=0}
Can use this to model habitat selection.

What about scaling effects?  

We can't just brush aside the collective action problem, but...  

maybe we can loosen the requirement that $Q$ remain constant relative to density?

__Units of analysis__

- Space: HUC 10 watersheds (N = 208) as defined by the USGS.  
- Time: 25-year time steps (N = 33)

__Project area__

- Space: the extent of watersheds that overlap with the Chaco world
- Time: years from 650 to 1450 (gives a buffer around start and end dates of Chaco great houses)

:::
::::
:::::
::::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=0}
__Proxies for productivity__

- Socioeconomic productivity
    - density per watershed of rooms at farms/pueblos   
    - density per watershed of rooms at great houses
    - assumption is that more rooms = more people
- Environmental productivity 
    - a paleo-climate reconstruction 
    - average precipitation and 
    - maize growing degree days (GDD)  
:::::
::::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=1}
__Response variables__

Model we are using is a Bayesian spatio-temporal count model fit using INLA in R.<sup style="color:#6f6f6f;">1</sup>  

Assumes the response is Poisson distributed:  

$$O|E \sim Poisson(E\cdot O)$$

where  

$E$ is the density across the project area multiplied by the area of each watershed, so an expected count, and  

$O$ is the ratio of the observed to the expected count, so values greater than one indicate a count greater than expected.

[1. Still trying to wrap my head around this. Just started using this approach about three days ago...]{style="position: absolute; bottom: 20px; font-size: 0.7em; color: #6f6f6f;"}
:::::
::::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=2}
__Model specification__  
Then model $O$ as a log-linear model:  

$$log\,(O) = \alpha + \beta X + u + v + w + \epsilon$$

where $u, v, w$ are random effects for space, time, and watershed. 

Actually includes smooth terms for potential non-linear effects.  
:::::
::::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=3}
__Intuition?__

We're not just modeling the locations of great houses, but their level of intensity relative to that of farm or pueblo sites.  

And, we are modeling each as a function of the environment. 

So, you can think of this model as answering the question: did some amount of historical inertia drive the distribution of great houses over and above environmental productivity?

## Data sources

<br>

![](figures/cybersw.png){width=150px}  
The archaeological data come from [cyberSW](https://cybersw.org/), _a cyberinfrastructure and collaborative space for conducting interdisciplinary research on and exploring the pre-Hispanic archaeological record of the US Southwest and Northwest Mexico_.  

<br>

[__SKOPE__]{.large}  
[Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments]{style="font-weight:bold; color:#003C54 !important;"}  
Paleo-climate data provided by [SKOPE](https://www.openskope.org/), specifically the [PaleoCAR](https://github.com/bocinsky/paleocar) model that regresses modern PRISM data on tree ring widths to hindcast past climates. 

## Data issues

:::::: {.r-stack width=100% style="margin-top:1em;" .flt}
::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index=0}
[__Resolution__]{.large}

__Room counts and density__: The area of a Chaco community is typically assumed to be roughly 150 km<sup>2</sup> (based on walking speed), but the HUC10 watersheds used in this analysis are 2 or 3 times larger than that.  

__Uncertainty__: Extremely difficult to measure our uncertainty around room count and density estimates.  

__Environmental smoothing__: Aggregating climate variables to the watershed level may bias our estimates of environmental productivity.

__Trade-off__: Using higher-resolution lattice data may capture more environmental variation, but it also increases the number of zero counts.

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=0}
[__Measurement__]{.large}

__Sampling intensity__: Archaeological data mostly come from cultural resource compliance, which is in turn driven by federal projects, and those tend to happen more in some areas than others. 

__Data integration__: Naming conventions and measurement standards are - let's say - inadequate in archaeology. That makes aggregating and comparing data in large regional analyses difficult. Can account for some of this using hierarchical models but _only if_ the variance across projects and regions is systematic.  
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=1}
Worth noting that many of the problems archaeologists face are structurally similar to those that ecologists wrestle with, so it's not like archaeologists are just out on a limb.
